# Software-Security

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a security assessment of its software to identify potential vulnerabilities and improve its overall security posture. The company sought assistance in identifying weaknesses in its system that could be exploited by cyber threats. By conducting a vulnerability assessment, I was able to analyze security gaps and provide recommendations for mitigation.
One of my key successes in the assessment was identifying and documenting security vulnerabilities effectively. Recognizing these weaknesses is crucial because coding securely prevents data breaches, protects user information, and strengthens the overall trustworthiness of a companyâ€™s software. Software security is essential for safeguarding sensitive financial data and maintaining compliance with industry regulations, which ultimately contributes to a company's reputation and operational stability.
During the vulnerability assessment, the most challenging yet rewarding aspect was analyzing potential exploits and determining the appropriate mitigation strategies. It required careful evaluation of security reports, testing methodologies, and refining security controls to enhance protection. I increased layers of security by implementing input validation, enforcing authentication and authorization measures, and ensuring secure data storage. In the future, I would utilize automated security scanning tools and conduct regular penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and determine the best mitigation strategies.
To ensure that the software remained functional and secure, I conducted rigorous testing after refactoring the code. This included unit testing, integration testing, and static code analysis to detect any newly introduced vulnerabilities. Additionally, I followed secure coding best practices such as minimizing hardcoded credentials, using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and applying encryption to protect sensitive information.
